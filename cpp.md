# C++ programmer errors

1. Used a reference type with the object pointed to by an iterator, then invalidated the iterator,
then tried to use the reference. Basically this:

```cpp
my::container container;
/* ... */
my::container::iterator it = container.begin();
/* ... */
{
    my::object& ref = *it;
    ++it;
    std::cout << ref << std::endl; // WRONG: access to invalid reference.
}
```

2. Forgot to const everything I could.

3. Forgot to const& function parameters where appropriate.

4. Forgot semicolon.

5. Split my code prematurely into hpp and cpp functions which made it hard to understand the
   operation of the whole TU at once.
